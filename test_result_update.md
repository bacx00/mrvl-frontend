## 🧪 **BACKEND SERVICE ISSUES (JUNE 20, 2025):**

### Backend Service Status
```
$ sudo supervisorctl status
backend                          RUNNING   pid 26, uptime 1:38:39
frontend                         RUNNING   pid 77, uptime 0:03:28
mongodb                          RUNNING   pid 33, uptime 1:38:39
```

### Backend Error Logs
```
$ tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log
==> /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log <==
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'
```

### Backend Configuration
```
$ cat /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf
[program:backend]
command=/root/.venv/bin/uvicorn backend.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --workers 1 --reload
directory=/app
```

### Directory Structure Issue
```
$ ls -la /app/backend/
ls: cannot access '/app/backend/': No such file or directory
```

### Frontend API Configuration
```
$ cat /app/frontend/.env
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://e4003c0a-8f1b-4723-a4c1-680f79fe84f6.preview.emergentagent.com
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:**

1. **Backend Service Failure:**
   - Backend service is configured but fails to start properly
   - Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`
   - The expected `/app/backend/` directory does not exist
   - All API endpoints return 502 Bad Gateway errors

2. **Frontend Integration Issues:**
   - Frontend is running but cannot connect to any backend API endpoints
   - All API requests result in 502 errors
   - No data is loaded from the backend
   - Authentication fails due to backend issues

## 🔧 **RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Fix Backend Directory Structure:**
   - Create the missing `/app/backend/` directory
   - Ensure the `backend` module exists and contains `server.py`

2. **Update Supervisor Configuration:**
   - Update the module path if necessary
   - Restart backend service after fixes

3. **Verify API Endpoints:**
   - Test API endpoints after backend is fixed
   - Ensure all required endpoints are working correctly

## 🎯 **CONCLUSION:**

The Marvel Rivals platform frontend UI is implemented correctly, but the backend service is not functioning. The backend service is configured to run but fails due to a missing module. All API endpoints return 502 errors, preventing any data from being loaded or any functionality that requires backend interaction from working.

**Overall Status: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - CRITICAL BACKEND ISSUES**
