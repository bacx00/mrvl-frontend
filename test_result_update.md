## 🧪 **BACKEND SERVICE ISSUES (JUNE 20, 2025):**

### Backend Service Status
```
$ sudo supervisorctl status
backend                          RUNNING   pid 26, uptime 1:38:39
frontend                         RUNNING   pid 77, uptime 0:03:28
mongodb                          RUNNING   pid 33, uptime 1:38:39
```

### Backend Error Logs
```
$ tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log
==> /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log <==
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'
```

### Backend Configuration
```
$ cat /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf
[program:backend]
command=/root/.venv/bin/uvicorn backend.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --workers 1 --reload
directory=/app
```

### Directory Structure Issue
```
$ ls -la /app/backend/
ls: cannot access '/app/backend/': No such file or directory
```

### Frontend API Configuration
```
$ cat /app/frontend/.env
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://e4003c0a-8f1b-4723-a4c1-680f79fe84f6.preview.emergentagent.com
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:**

1. **Backend Service Failure:**
   - Backend service is configured but fails to start properly
   - Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`
   - The expected `/app/backend/` directory does not exist
   - All API endpoints return 502 Bad Gateway errors

2. **Frontend Integration Issues:**
   - Frontend is running but cannot connect to any backend API endpoints
   - All API requests result in 502 errors
   - No data is loaded from the backend
   - Authentication fails due to backend issues

3. **Hero Image System Issues (June 21, 2025):**
   - Frontend is using incorrect URL format for hero images
   - The frontend is not correctly extracting the image URL from the API response
   - Text fallbacks for heroes without images are not displaying properly
   - This affects all hero images across the platform

## 🔧 **RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Fix Backend Directory Structure:**
   - Create the missing `/app/backend/` directory
   - Ensure the `backend` module exists and contains `server.py`

2. **Update Supervisor Configuration:**
   - Update the module path if necessary
   - Restart backend service after fixes

3. **Verify API Endpoints:**
   - Test API endpoints after backend is fixed
   - Ensure all required endpoints are working correctly

4. **Fix Hero Image System (June 21, 2025):**
   - Fix the URL construction in the frontend code
   - Extract the `image_url` from the API response and use it directly
   - Example: `const imageUrl = data.data.image_url;`
   - Ensure proper error handling for missing images
   - Test with both heroes that have images and those that don't

## 🎯 **CONCLUSION:**

The Marvel Rivals platform frontend UI is implemented correctly, but there are issues with both the backend service and the hero image system. The backend service is not functioning due to a missing module, and the hero image system has an issue with URL construction in the frontend code.

**Overall Status: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - CRITICAL BACKEND ISSUES AND HERO IMAGE SYSTEM ISSUES**
