## 🧪 **BACKEND SERVICE ISSUES (JUNE 20, 2025):**

### Backend Service Status
```
$ sudo supervisorctl status
backend                          RUNNING   pid 26, uptime 1:38:39
frontend                         RUNNING   pid 77, uptime 0:03:28
mongodb                          RUNNING   pid 33, uptime 1:38:39
```

### Backend Error Logs
```
$ tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.*.log
==> /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log <==
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'
```

### Backend Configuration
```
$ cat /etc/supervisor/conf.d/supervisord.conf
[program:backend]
command=/root/.venv/bin/uvicorn backend.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --workers 1 --reload
directory=/app
```

### Directory Structure Issue
```
$ ls -la /app/backend/
ls: cannot access '/app/backend/': No such file or directory
```

### Frontend API Configuration
```
$ cat /app/frontend/.env
WDS_SOCKET_PORT=443
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://4403fb61-ff73-4f47-b23f-bb2a003ca29f.preview.emergentagent.com
```

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:**

1. **Backend Service Failure:**
   - Backend service is configured but fails to start properly
   - Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`
   - The expected `/app/backend/` directory does not exist
   - All API endpoints return 502 Bad Gateway errors

2. **Frontend Integration Issues:**
   - Frontend is running but cannot connect to any backend API endpoints
   - All API requests result in 502 errors
   - No data is loaded from the backend
   - Authentication fails due to backend issues

3. **Hero Image System Issues (June 21, 2025 - UPDATE):**
   - ✅ The URL construction issue in the frontend code has been fixed
   - ✅ Direct access to hero images works correctly for heroes with images
   - ✅ Heroes without images correctly return 404 errors when accessed directly
   - ❌ Cannot fully test the hero image integration in the UI due to backend service failure
   - This issue is now resolved in the code, but full testing is not possible due to backend issues

## 🔧 **RECOMMENDATIONS:**

1. **Fix Backend Directory Structure:**
   - Create the missing `/app/backend/` directory
   - Ensure the `backend` module exists and contains `server.py`

2. **Update Supervisor Configuration:**
   - Update the module path if necessary
   - Restart backend service after fixes

3. **Verify API Endpoints:**
   - Test API endpoints after backend is fixed
   - Ensure all required endpoints are working correctly

3. **Fix Hero Image System (June 21, 2025 - UPDATE):**
   - ✅ The URL construction in the frontend code has been fixed
   - ✅ The code now uses the `image_url` from the API response directly without concatenation
   - ✅ Direct access to hero images works correctly for heroes with images
   - ✅ Heroes without images correctly return 404 errors when accessed directly
   - ❌ Cannot fully test the hero image integration in the UI due to backend service failure
   - Recommendation: Fix the backend issues to enable full testing of the hero image system

## 🎯 **CONCLUSION:**

The Marvel Rivals platform frontend UI is implemented correctly, and the hero image system URL construction issue has been fixed in the code. However, there are still issues with the backend service. The backend service is not functioning due to a missing module, which prevents full testing of the hero image system in the UI.

**Overall Status: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION - CRITICAL BACKEND ISSUES PREVENT FULL TESTING**
