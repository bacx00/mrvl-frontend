## 📊 Player Statistics Management

### Comprehensive Stats Tracking
The system successfully tracks all Marvel Rivals core statistics:

```javascript
{
  "player_id": 1,
  "player_name": "Player1",
  "hero": "Spider-Man",
  "eliminations": 15,    // Kills
  "deaths": 5,
  "assists": 10,
  "damage": 5500,        // Damage dealt
  "healing": 0,          // Support healing
  "damage_blocked": 0    // Tank damage mitigation
}
```

### Map Isolation
- ✅ Each map maintains separate player statistics
- ✅ Stats don't bleed between maps
- ✅ Historical data preserved for completed maps
- ✅ Clean slate for new maps

---

## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Input Validation Gaps
**Priority: HIGH**

**Issue:** The system accepts invalid data in certain edge cases:
- Negative scores (team1_score: -5)
- Invalid map numbers (current_map: 999)

**Example Failing Cases:**
```javascript
// This should be rejected but is accepted
{
  "status": "live",
  "current_map": 999,  // Invalid map number
  "maps": [{
    "team1_score": -5,  // Invalid negative score
    "team2_score": 3
  }]
}
```

**Recommendation:** Implement server-side validation for:
- Score ranges (0 ≤ score ≤ reasonable_maximum)
- Map number validation (1 ≤ map_number ≤ format_maximum)
- Data type validation (numeric fields must be numbers)

### 2. Live Scoreboard Endpoint Issues
**Priority: MEDIUM**

**Issue:** The `/matches/{id}/live-scoreboard` endpoint returns 500 errors
- Possible data corruption in maps_data JSON field
- Frontend components may experience display issues

**Recommendation:** Debug and fix the live scoreboard endpoint for real-time viewing
