### System Status: PRODUCTION READY ‚úÖ

## üîß FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Security Enhancements
```javascript
// FIXED: XSS vulnerability in MobileTextEditor preview
// BEFORE: dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: value.replace(/\n/g, '<br>') }}
// AFTER: Safe text rendering with whitespace-pre-wrap
<div className="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 whitespace-pre-wrap">
  {value}
</div>
```

### 2. Error Handling
```javascript
// ADDED: React Error Boundary wrapper in App.js
function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary component="App">
      <ThemeProvider>
        <AuthProvider>
          <ErrorBoundary component="AppContent">
            <AppContent />
          </ErrorBoundary>
        </AuthProvider>
      </ThemeProvider>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

### 3. Mobile Experience Optimization
```javascript
// ENHANCED: Mobile-aware dropdown positioning
if (isMobile) {
  const keyboardHeight = 260;
  const availableHeight = viewportHeight - keyboardHeight;
  const dropdownHeight = Math.min(200, availableHeight * 0.4);
  
  return {
    position: 'fixed',
    bottom: `${keyboardHeight + 10}px`,
    left: '0.5rem',
    right: '0.5rem',
    maxHeight: `${dropdownHeight}px`,
    borderRadius: '12px',
    backdropFilter: 'blur(10px)',
    // ... mobile-optimized styles
  };
}
```

### 4. Performance Optimizations
```javascript
// ADDED: Request debouncing and cancellation
useEffect(() => {
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    if (mentionQuery.length >= 1) {
      searchMentions(mentionQuery, mentionType);
    }
  }, 300); // 300ms debounce

  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}, [mentionQuery, mentionType]);

// ADDED: Abort controller for race condition prevention
const response = await api.get(endpoint, {
  signal: abortController.signal
});
```
