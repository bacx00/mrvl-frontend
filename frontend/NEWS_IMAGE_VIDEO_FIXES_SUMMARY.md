# MRVL News Image & Video Embedding Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Featured Image Upload & Display Issue ✅

**Problem**: Featured images were not showing up in news articles even though upload succeeded.

**Root Cause**: 
- Frontend was sending the wrong field name (`image` instead of `featured_image`)
- Inconsistent endpoint handling between frontend and backend
- Missing proper response handling after image upload

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Backend (`/var/www/mrvl-backend/app/Http/Controllers/ImageUploadController.php`)
- ✅ Enhanced `uploadNewsFeaturedImage()` to support both `featured_image` and `image` field names
- ✅ Added `uploadNewsImages()` method for backward compatibility
- ✅ Improved error handling and response structure

#### Frontend (`/var/www/mrvl-frontend/frontend/src/components/admin/NewsForm.js`)
- ✅ Fixed FormData field name to use `featured_image`
- ✅ Improved image upload response handling
- ✅ Added proper error messaging for image upload failures
- ✅ Enhanced state management for uploaded images

---

### 2. Video Embedding Issues ✅

**Problem**: Video embedding was described as "a mess" and not working properly.

**Root Causes**:
- Server-side rendering compatibility issues
- Domain validation problems for Twitch embeds
- Missing error handling for video components

**Fixes Applied**:

#### Video Utilities (`/var/www/mrvl-frontend/frontend/src/utils/videoUtils.js`)
- ✅ Enhanced domain handling for localhost and development environments
- ✅ Improved Twitch embed domain validation
- ✅ Better error handling for video URL processing

#### Video Components (`/var/www/mrvl-frontend/frontend/src/components/shared/VideoEmbed.js`)
- ✅ Added server-side rendering (SSR) compatibility checks
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for iframe loading
- ✅ Improved mobile optimization detection
- ✅ Fixed Twitter widget loading issues

#### Video Preview (`/var/www/mrvl-frontend/frontend/src/components/shared/VideoPreview.js`)
- ✅ Already properly implemented with VLR.gg integration
- ✅ Comprehensive video platform support (YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, VLR.gg)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Image Upload Flow
```
Frontend (NewsForm) → Backend (ImageUploadController) → Database (News.featured_image) → Display (NewsCard)
```

1. **Upload**: `POST /admin/news/{id}/featured-image` with `featured_image` field
2. **Storage**: Processed and stored in `storage/app/public/news/featured/`
3. **Database**: Path saved to `News.featured_image` column
4. **Display**: Retrieved via `getImageUrl()` utility with proper URL generation

### Video Embedding Flow
```
Content Input → Video Detection → Embed Processing → Display Components
```

1. **Detection**: `detectAllVideoUrls()` identifies video URLs in content
2. **Processing**: `processContentForVideos()` extracts and processes video data
3. **Storage**: Video metadata stored in news articles
4. **Display**: `VideoEmbed` components render videos with platform-specific handling

## API Endpoints

### Image Upload
```
POST /api/admin/news/{newsId}/featured-image
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: featured_image (file)

Response: {
  "success": true,

  "data": {
    "featured_image": "news/featured/abc123.jpg",
    "featured_image_url": "http://localhost:8000/storage/news/featured/abc123.jpg"
  }
}
```

### Backward Compatibility
```
POST /api/admin/news/{newsId}/images
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: image (file) OR featured_image (file)

Automatically routes to featured image upload
```

- File size limits enforced
- Secure file naming (random strings)
- Path traversal protection

### Video Embedding Security
- URL validation and sanitization
- CSP-compatible embed domains
- No direct script injection
- Platform-specific security measures
