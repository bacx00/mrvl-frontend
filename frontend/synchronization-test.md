# Match Score Synchronization Test

## Test Scenario: BO3 Match Creation and Display

### Steps to Test:

1. **Create BO3 Match in MatchForm**:
   - Select Team 1 and Team 2
   - Set format to BO3
   - Set status to "completed"
   - Set map scores:
     - Map 1: Team1: 2, Team2: 0 (Team1 wins)
     - Map 2: Team1: 1, Team2: 2 (Team2 wins) 
     - Map 3: Team1: 2, Team2: 1 (Team1 wins)
   - Save the match

2. **Expected Backend Data**:
   - `team1_score: 2` (series score - Team1 won 2 maps)
   - `team2_score: 1` (series score - Team2 won 1 map)
   - `maps_data`: JSON array with 3 maps containing individual scores and winner_id

3. **Navigate to MatchDetailPage**:
   - Should show overall series score: Team1: 2 - Team2: 1
   - Should show individual map scores:
     - Map 1: 2-0 (Team1 winner highlighted)
     - Map 2: 1-2 (Team2 winner highlighted)
     - Map 3: 2-1 (Team1 winner highlighted)

4. **Open in LiveScoring**:
   - Should load existing map scores
   - Should show completed maps as "completed" status
   - Should display existing player compositions
   - Should show correct series score

### Key Fixes Applied:

1. **MatchForm**: 
   - Now calculates series scores from map winners
   - Includes winner_id in maps_data
   - Sets map status based on completion

2. **MatchDetailPage**:
   - Handles both camelCase and snake_case field names
   - Displays series scores directly from match.team1_score/team2_score
   - Shows map-level scores with winner highlighting

3. **LiveScoring**:
   - Properly loads from maps_data
   - Sets map status to "completed" when winner_id exists
   - Maintains synchronization with MatchForm data

### Verification Points:

✅ Map scores created in MatchForm appear in MatchDetailPage
✅ Series scores are calculated correctly
✅ LiveScoring loads existing scores for editing
✅ Data consistency across all components
