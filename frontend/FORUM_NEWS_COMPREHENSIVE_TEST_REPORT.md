## üõ† Technical Analysis

### Components Examined

#### Forum Components:
- `/src/components/pages/ForumsPage.js` - Main forum interface
- `/src/components/pages/ThreadDetailPage.js` - Thread display and interaction
- `/src/components/shared/ForumMentionAutocomplete.js` - **KEY FIX LOCATION**

// Safe wrapper function implemented in components
const safeString = (value) => {
    if (typeof value === 'string') return value;
    if (value === null || value === undefined) return '';
    if (typeof value === 'object') {
        if (value.message) return value.message;
        if (value.content) return String(value.content);
        return '';
    }
    return String(value);
};
```

### Data Flow Validation:

1. **User Types Mention** ‚Üí Autocomplete triggered
2. **Search Results** ‚Üí Safe string conversion applied
3. **Mention Selection** ‚Üí Proper formatting preserved
