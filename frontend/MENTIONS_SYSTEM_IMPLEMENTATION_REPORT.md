# MRVL Tournament Platform - Complete Mentions System Implementation

## Overview
The mentions system has been fully implemented and integrated across all sections of the MRVL tournament platform. Users can now mention players, teams, and other users using @username, @team:teamname, and @player:playername formats.

## ‚úÖ Backend Implementation

### Database Structure
- **Table**: `mentions`
- **Polymorphic Relations**: Support for news, forums, matches, and comments
- **Migration**: `/var/www/mrvl-backend/database/migrations/2025_07_14_061658_create_mentions_table.php`

### API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `/api/mentions/search` | GET | Search for mentionable entities |
| `/api/mentions/popular` | GET | Get popular mentions |
| `/api/mentions/create` | POST | Create mentions from content |
| `/api/mentions/delete` | DELETE | Delete mentions when content is removed |
| `/api/players/{id}/mentions` | GET | Get mentions for a specific player |
| `/api/teams/{id}/mentions` | GET | Get mentions for a specific team |
| `/api/users/{id}/mentions` | GET | Get mentions for a specific user |

### Models & Controllers
- **Model**: `App\Models\Mention` with polymorphic relationships
- **Controller**: `App\Http\Controllers\MentionController` with full CRUD operations
- **Service**: `App\Services\MentionService` for mention processing
- **Events**: `MentionCreated` and `MentionDeleted` for real-time updates
- **Notifications**: `MentionNotification` for user alerts

## ‚úÖ Frontend Implementation

### Core Components
1. **MentionLink** (`/src/components/shared/MentionLink.js`)
   - Renders clickable mention links
   - Supports navigation to player, team, and user profiles
   - Color-coded by entity type (blue=player, red=team, green=user)

2. **MentionsSection** (`/src/components/shared/MentionsSection.js`)
   - Displays mention history on profile pages
   - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds for real-time updates
   - Pagination support

3. **UserDisplay** (`/src/components/shared/UserDisplay.js`)
   - Enhanced `parseTextWithMentions` function
   - Supports all mention formats: @username, @team:teamname, @player:playername
   - Converts mentions to clickable components

### Mention Processing Utilities
- **File**: `/src/utils/mentionUtils.js`
- **Functions**:
  - `processContentWithMentions()` - Converts text with mentions to React components
  - `extractMentionsFromContent()` - Client-side mention detection
  - `formatMentionForDisplay()` - Format mentions for UI display
  - `isValidMentionFormat()` - Validate mention syntax

### Integration Points

#### 1. Player Profiles (`PlayerDetailPage.js`)
- Biography section now displays clickable mentions
- Loads mention data for parsing
- Supports navigation to mentioned entities

#### 2. Team Profiles (`TeamDetailPage.js`)
- Team description displays clickable mentions
- Includes mentions section showing recent mentions of the team
- Auto-refreshing mention data

#### 3. News Articles (`NewsDetailPage.js`)
- Article titles, excerpts, and content process mentions
- Comment system supports mentions in user comments
- Consistent mention styling throughout

#### 4. Forums & Matches
- Forum threads and match comments support mention parsing
- Existing `parseTextWithMentions` integration maintained
- Consistent user experience across all content types

## ‚úÖ Real-Time Features

- Mentions sections auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Non-disruptive updates (only first page refreshes)
- Error handling for network issues

### Live Update Service
- Foundation in place for WebSocket/Pusher integration
- Event system supports `MentionCreated` and `MentionDeleted`

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Mention Detection Regex
```javascript
const mentionPatterns = [
  { regex: /@player:([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)/g, type: 'player', prefix: '@player:' },
  { regex: /@team:([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)/g, type: 'team', prefix: '@team:' },
  { regex: /@([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)(?!:)/g, type: 'user', prefix: '@' }
];
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE mentions (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  mentionable_type VARCHAR(255), -- Content type containing the mention
  mentionable_id BIGINT,         -- Content ID
  mentioned_type VARCHAR(255),   -- Entity type mentioned (player/team/user)
  mentioned_id BIGINT,           -- Entity ID
  mention_text VARCHAR(255),     -- Original mention text
  context TEXT,                  -- Surrounding text context
  position_start INT,            -- Start position in content
  position_end INT,              -- End position in content
  mentioned_by BIGINT,           -- User who made the mention
  mentioned_at TIMESTAMP,        -- When mention was created
  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE -- Soft delete flag
);
```

### API Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 123,
      "type": "player",
      "name": "s1mple",
      "display_name": "Oleksandr Kostyliev",
      "mention_text": "@player:s1mple",
      "url": "/players/123",
      "avatar": "...",
      "subtitle": "AWPer ‚Ä¢ NAVI"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**: Mention autocomplete data cached for 30 minutes
2. **Pagination**: Efficient loading with limit/offset
3. **Debouncing**: Search queries debounced to prevent API spam
4. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of intervals and subscriptions
