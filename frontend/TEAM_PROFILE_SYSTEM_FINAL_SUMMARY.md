## 🖼️ Image Fallback System Deep Dive

### The Question Mark Solution

The team profile system implements a **sophisticated fallback mechanism** that ensures professional appearance even when team logos are missing:

```javascript
// When team logo is missing/invalid:
<TeamLogo team={team} size="w-8 h-8" />
// Automatically displays:
```

**Visual Result:**
```
┌─────────────┐
│      ?      │  ← Clean, professional placeholder
│             │    instead of broken image
└─────────────┘
```

### Fallback Scenarios Handled:
1. **Null team object** → Question mark placeholder
2. **Missing logo field** → Question mark placeholder  
3. **Empty string logo** → Question mark placeholder
4. **Blob URLs** → Question mark placeholder (prevents broken references)
5. **Emoji paths** → Question mark placeholder (prevents display issues)
6. **Invalid URLs** → Question mark placeholder with error handling

### Technical Implementation:
- **Data URI SVG** for instant loading (no network requests)
- **Consistent styling** with light/dark mode support
- **Professional appearance** matching platform design
- **Error recovery** with onError handlers

```
**Solution:** Update certificate or API configuration (DevOps task)
**Impact:** Minimal - backend code structure is solid, just connectivity issue

### Issue #2: Team History/Profile Sections
**Status:** Should be reviewed for removal (similar to player profiles)
**Recommendation:** Keep current implementation as it's well-structured and user-friendly
