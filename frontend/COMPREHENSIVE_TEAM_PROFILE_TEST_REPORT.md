## 🔍 Detailed Test Results

### 1. Team API Endpoints Test

**Status:** ❌ Failed (SSL Certificate Issue)  
**Issue:** Certificate hostname mismatch (`1039tfjgievqa983.mrvl.net` vs `staging.mrvl.net`)

```
Error: ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID
Host: 1039tfjgievqa983.mrvl.net. is not in the cert's altnames: DNS:staging.mrvl.net

5. **Null/Undefined** → Question mark placeholder

### Question Mark Placeholder
```svg
<svg width="40" height="40" viewBox="0 0 40 40" fill="none">
  <circle cx="20" cy="20" r="20" fill="#F3F4F6"/>
  <text x="20" y="28" font-family="system-ui" font-size="20" 
        font-weight="bold" fill="#6B7280" text-anchor="middle">?</text>
</svg>
```
