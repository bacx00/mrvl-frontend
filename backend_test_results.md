- ✅ Player data in match details: Complete with all required fields

### Authentication System
- ❌ Login endpoint (/api/login): Not found (404 error)
- ❓ Logout endpoint (/api/logout): Not tested due to login failure
- ❓ User profile endpoint (/api/user): Not tested due to login failure

### Live Match Data

## Detailed Findings

### Core API Endpoints
All core API endpoints are responding with 200 status codes and returning properly structured JSON data. The data includes all necessary fields for the frontend to display teams, matches, events, rankings, and forum threads.

### Match Detail Data
The match detail endpoint is working correctly and returns comprehensive data about matches, including:
- Match metadata (id, status, format, etc.)
- Team information with logos and ratings
- Player rosters for both teams with roles and ratings
- Maps information with scores
- Series information with format and current score

### Authentication System
The authentication system has an issue with the login endpoint. The API route `/api/login` returns a 404 error, indicating the endpoint does not exist or is not properly configured. This prevents testing the authenticated endpoints like logout and user profile.

### Live Match Data
The live match data is working correctly. The API provides:
- Current match status
- Maps information with names and scores
- Series format and current score
- Team and player information

## Recommendations

1. **Authentication System**: The login endpoint needs to be fixed. According to the routes file, it should be available at `/api/login`, but it's returning a 404 error. This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed.

2. **Match Detail Structure**: While the match detail endpoint is working, there's a slight inconsistency in the data structure. The API returns data wrapped in a "data" object, which requires the frontend to handle this nesting.

3. **Live Match Data**: The live match data is working correctly, but the scores for all maps are currently 0-0. This might be because there are no active matches with scores, but it would be good to verify that the scoring system can update these values in real-time.

## Conclusion

The Marvel Rivals platform backend is mostly working correctly, with all core API endpoints functioning as expected. The match detail data and live match data are well-structured and provide all the necessary information for the frontend.

The only critical issue is with the authentication system, where the login endpoint is not found. This needs to be fixed to enable authenticated features like user profiles, match commenting, and admin functions.

Overall, the backend is ready to support the improved frontend match detail page with hero images and VLR.gg style layout, but the authentication issue should be addressed before deploying to production.
