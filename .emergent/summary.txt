The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the development of a Marvel Rivals esports platform, transitioning from initial MVP build to feature enhancements and critical bug fixes. Initially, the focus was on resolving frontend data display and input issues, particularly with player statistics ( in ) and match data persistence ( in ). A significant turning point involved the user providing comprehensive backend API updates, which clarified that many frontend data synchronization problems stemmed from stale or incorrectly structured data returned by the *old* backend.

Following the backend update, the AI engineer integrated new concepts like  for cross-tab synchronization and rigorously debugged frontend components (, , ) to align with the new data expectations. Key fixes included hero loading,  edit errors, timer synchronization across tabs, and addressing React Hooks issues. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer acknowledging a  declaration build error, poised to integrate the *new, consistent backend APIs* which the user explicitly stated resolve data consistency issues.

<product_requirements>
The overarching goal is a fully functional Marvel Rivals esports platform enabling accurate live match input and display. Key features include:
*   **Match Creation & Persistence ():** Admins create 6v6 matches, specifying teams, game modes, maps, and categorized Marvel Rivals heroes. All  (hero compositions, map details) must persist and be accurately retrieved. The 'event' field is optional, and match status (, ) must update.
*   **Live Match Administration ():** Real-time updates for player statistics (kills, deaths, assists, damage, healing, blocked damage) and hero changes without state loss. Player images and country flags must display correctly with a compact interface.
*   **Public Match Display ():** Accurate display of match details: map name, game mode, heroes, player names, country flags. Real-time synchronization for timer, match status (, ), and scores. Includes Stream Watch and VOD buttons, with player rows linking to profiles.
*   **Image Display:** Correct display of team logos, player avatars, event/live banners, and news article images, with proper fallbacks and fading effects for banners.
*   **Data Consistency:** Seamless, fully synchronized data flow from  to Backend, then to  and . This was explicitly confirmed by the user via a new backend API that guarantees instant data consistency.
*   **UI Polish:** Removal of unnecessary icons from Events and Home pages.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development:** React (Frontend) and Laravel 11 (Backend).
-   **API Integration:** RESTful APIs, Bearer token authentication, Data Transformation Layer ().
-   **Frontend State Management:** React Hooks (, ) and Custom DOM Events.
-   **Cross-Tab Communication:**  API for synchronization.
-   **Component-Based Design:** Modular React components.
-   **UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS for styling.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Stores , crucial for frontend API calls. Was previously fixed to point to the correct staging domain.
-   ****: Centralizes all match-related frontend-backend communication. It was extensively modified for new backend live scoring endpoints and data transformations. It requires further updates to utilize the *new* backend admin endpoints for guaranteed data consistency (Chat 294).
-   ****: Handles match creation and editing. It was updated to correctly send  (hero compositions), ensure heroes are categorized by role, and pre-fill selected heroes. A fix was implemented to prevent  errors when editing match status ().
-   ****: The admin interface for live match updates. Manages real-time stats, hero changes, and timer events. Extensive modifications were made to resolve player ID mapping issues (initially believed fixed, then backend confirmed as source), remove duplicate UI elements, and implement cross-tab synchronization using  for timer, scores, and hero updates. Currently has a  variable declaration build error.
-   ****: Public-facing match detail view. Displays scores, players, heroes, map, mode, and match status. Updated to use the correct  endpoint, fix player name display, ensure timer sync (now via ), correct button visibility (e.g., Watch Stream), and resolve React Hooks nesting issues.
-   ****: Provides utility functions for image URLs, like , which was verified to be working.
-   **Backend files (Laravel)**: While not directly modified by the AI engineer, the trajectory describes critical updates to  (Model), , and  to support new live-scoring endpoints with guaranteed instant data consistency. These backend changes are pivotal for the frontend's correct functioning.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Forums Data Display:** New categories not updating and backend API error loading forum data.
-   **Image Display across pages:** Fix article images not displaying. Ensure faded background images for event/live banners if not already working.
-   **UI Cleanup:** Remove unnecessary icons from Events and Home pages.
-   **Events Page Data:** Fix incorrect team/event data displayed.
-   **Backend API Integration (Main Task):** Update  to utilize the *new* backend admin endpoints for player stats, team composition, and timer, as provided in Chat Message 294, to fully leverage instant data consistency and resolve persistent scoreboard/hero synchronization issues.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving cross-tab synchronization issues for the live match updates.

The previous work involved:
1.  **Debugging  errors:** Initially thought to be a frontend mapping issue in  and , which was partially addressed.
2.  **Fixing Hero Loading and Display:** Resolved issues in  and  where heroes were not populating in dropdowns or were displaying outdated names like Phoenix. This involved using React state for heroes and implementing a  fallback function.
3.  **Resolving MatchForm Edit Errors:** Fixed  when editing matches by adding null checks.
4.  **Implementing Cross-Tab Timer Sync:** Initially attempted with , which failed across tabs. It was then successfully re-implemented using  events to ensure the timer in  synced instantly with actions in .
5.  **Fixing React Hooks Errors:** Resolved a  nesting issue in  that caused build failures.
6.  **Implementing Cross-Tab Score/Hero Sync:** Extended the  approach to synchronize scoreboard and hero changes between  (admin) and  (public). This was confirmed to be working at the  event level.

The immediate problem identified by the user after the cross-tab sync implementation was that despite the  events triggering, the  was still showing stale scoreboard and hero data. This led to the crucial realization (confirmed by the user providing new backend API documentation) that the backend itself was responsible for the data consistency, and the frontend was likely still calling outdated endpoints.

The last action in the trajectory (Chat Message 301) indicates a new build error: . This is the very immediate task being addressed.
