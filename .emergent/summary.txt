The previous AI engineer's work primarily revolved around fixing and integrating the live scoring functionality for a Marvel Rivals esports platform. Initially, the focus was on frontend issues like scoreboard synchronization and data display inconsistencies, with an early misdiagnosis attributing persistent score display problems to the backend. A major turning point occurred when a comprehensive backend test suite was run, revealing that the backend was, in fact, 99.61% functional and tournament-ready, including score aggregation and player statistics persistence. This shifted the problem's scope entirely to a frontend integration issue: the frontend components (, , ) were using incorrect API endpoints, data formats, and parsing logic, leading to persistent  and un-updated scores/stats. The engineer repeatedly attempted to align frontend parsing with the actual backend API response structure ( instead of ) and correct endpoint usage, but faced persistent errors and already updated file states, indicating underlying issues or previous, unrecorded attempts. The trajectory concludes with ongoing efforts to fix  and  to correctly consume the backend's data.

The objective is to establish a fully functional Marvel Rivals esports platform featuring real-time live match capabilities. This includes robust match creation with persistent 6v6 team compositions and categorized heroes. Live administration requires real-time player statistics (kills, deaths, assists, damage, healing, blocked damage), hero changes without state loss, and accurate score updates. The public match display must show real-time scores, player/hero details, and match status, with seamless cross-tab synchronization. Image handling across the application (team logos, player avatars, event banners, news) needs to be correct with proper fallbacks. Data consistency is paramount, relying on a backend API promising instant data consistency. Minor UI polishes, like removing unnecessary icons, are also required. The core problem currently being addressed is the persistent failure of overall match scores and player statistics to update on the public-facing  despite backend operations and cross-tab events.

-   ****: Stores  for frontend API calls.
-   ****: Centralizes all match-related frontend-backend communication.
    -   **Summary**: This file is critical for fetching and updating match data, scores, and player statistics. It acts as the data layer between the UI and the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Multiple attempts to correct API endpoints and data parsing. Initially modified to integrate comprehensive backend admin endpoints and handle  sync. Recent changes aimed to align its data transformation logic with the actual backend response structure ( instead of ) and use correct API endpoints like  and . It also had a compilation error due to duplicate variable declaration () which was addressed.
-   ****: Handles match creation and editing.
    -   **Summary**: Manages input fields and data submission for creating and updating match details.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct explicit modifications observed in this trajectory, but implicitly involved as it creates matches that are then managed by live scoring.
-   ****: The admin interface for live match updates.
    -   **Summary**: Manages real-time stats, hero changes, and timer events. Dispatches updates to the backend and triggers  events for cross-tab sync.
    -   **Changes Made**: Fixed  declaration error. Updates to  and  to use new  methods were attempted. Logic for score increment/decrement buttons was modified to send correct map completion data to the backend. Current efforts are focused on ensuring it correctly utilizes the backend's tournament-ready API structure.
-   ****: Public-facing match detail view.
    -   **Summary**: Displays live scores, players, heroes, map, mode, and match status to the public. Listens for cross-tab sync events.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially had a frontend band-aid fix () to aggregate scores due to perceived backend issues. This fix was planned for removal once the backend was confirmed to aggregate correctly. Recent efforts are to fix errors related to reading  and ensure it uses the correct  endpoint and parses the response structure correctly.
-   ****: Provides utility functions for image URLs.
    -   **Summary**: Helps construct image URLs for various assets.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct modifications.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into fixing the frontend's integration with the *now-confirmed-as-working* backend. The core problem identified in the latest console logs ( and ) is a  occurring in  when  is called, and  when fetching match data.

This error stems from a mismatch in the expected data structure: the frontend code (specifically ) expects , but the backend's actual  response provides . Additionally, the  is shown as  in some frontend console logs (, ), which is a critical configuration issue that could prevent API calls from resolving correctly.

The engineer's recent efforts have been concentrated on:
1.  **Correcting :** Updating the data transformation logic within  to correctly parse the backend's  structure instead of . There were also attempts to fix endpoints for player stats (e.g., to use ) and ensure score updates sent the correct map completion status, aligning with the new backend documentation. However, several file already contains updated code observations suggest previous, possibly unrecorded, attempts or issues with the file editing tool.
2.  **Updating  and :** The explicit plan is to ensure these components use the  endpoint and correctly interpret the received data, removing any previous band-aid fixes for score aggregation. The trajectory ends with the engineer about to fix .

The persistent errors indicate that the core data parsing in  for the  endpoint, and potentially the environment variable loading (), are still the major blockers. Despite the backend being fully functional, the frontend is failing to correctly consume its data.
