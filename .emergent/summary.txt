The trajectory outlines the transition of a Marvel Rivals esports platform from an AI engineer to a human expert. The initial AI engineer successfully built the app from 0 to 1, and the current task is to summarize that work for future development.

The previous AI engineer initially focused on frontend fixes for live match input and display, addressing state management and data synchronization in React components like , , and . A critical early finding was the  using the wrong API endpoint and  failing to send . After several iterations where the AI engineer reported build successful but the user reported same issues, a major breakthrough occurred: the AI engineer provided comprehensive backend fixes to the user, including new endpoints for status, team composition, current map, timer, scores, and player statistics, and database schema updates. This backend transformation was crucial as it addressed the root cause of data persistence issues, particularly  and player hero compositions.

Post-backend updates, the current AI engineer integrated these new backend capabilities into the frontend, focusing on . While initial tests showed success with BO1 matches and basic data flow, subsequent user feedback revealed persistent or new issues across all major components, particularly  still failing to save player stats due to  player IDs, and  having UI/data synchronization issues. The trajectory ends with the current AI engineer acknowledging the  issue is still critical, indicating the need for further debugging despite previous attempts to fix it.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to deliver a fully functional Marvel Rivals esports platform with accurate live match input and display. The frontend (React) must integrate seamlessly with the existing Laravel PHP backend (read-only for frontend engineer, but backend API can be updated by user/previous AI).

**Key Features Required:**
*   **Match Creation & Persistence ():** Admins must create 6v6 matches, selecting teams, game modes, maps, and specific Marvel Rivals heroes (Vanguard, Duelist, Strategist). All selections (especially hero compositions and map details via ) must persist to the backend and be retrieved accurately. The 'event' field should be optional, and the status UI (, ) must update correctly.
*   **Live Match Administration ():** Real-time updates of player statistics (kills, deaths, assists, damage, healing, blocked damage) and hero changes without state loss or resets. Player images and country flags must display correctly. The interface needs to be compact.
*   **Public Match Display ():** Accurate display of all match details: map name, game mode, heroes, player names, player country flags. Real-time synchronization with admin updates, including timer, match status (, ), and scores. Must include Stream Watch and VOD buttons, and player rows should link to player profiles.
*   **Image Display:** Team logos, player avatars, event banners, live banners, and article images must be fetched and displayed correctly with proper fallbacks and fading effects for banners.
*   **Data Consistency:** Ensure seamless, fully synchronized data flow across  → Backend →  → .
*   **UI Polish:** Remove unnecessary icons from various pages (Events, Home).

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development:** React (Frontend), Laravel 11 (Backend), MySQL.
-   **API Integration:** RESTful APIs, Bearer token authentication, Data Transformation Layer (MatchAPI.js).
-   **Frontend State Management:** React , , Custom DOM Events for real-time sync.
-   **Component-Based Design:** Modular React components.
-   **UI/UX:** Tailwind CSS for styling, responsive design.

**Key Files and Their Importance:**

*   ****: Crucial for configuring the . Was fixed to point to the correct staging domain.
*   ****: This file is central to all frontend-backend communication for match-related data. It was heavily modified to include new methods for interacting with the 7 new backend live scoring endpoints (e.g., , , , , , , ). It also contains critical data transformation logic to map backend responses to frontend state, and was subject to numerous syntax fixes and duplicate method removals. Its  method currently exhibits a critical  issue.
*   ****: Handles the creation and editing of matches. Important for correctly sending  (hero compositions, map details) to the backend. Was updated to ensure heroes are categorized by role and to pre-fill previously selected heroes when editing.
*   ****: The admin interface for live match updates. Critical for real-time stats and hero changes. It fetches scoreboard data, dispatches timer events, and saves player stats. It has been a constant source of issues related to player ID mapping, excessive re-rendering, and duplicate UI elements. Its core functionality is still broken due to  errors.
*   ****: The public-facing match detail view. It consumes data from the backend to display scores, players, heroes, map, mode, and match status. It was updated to use the correct  endpoint, fix player name display, ensure timer sync, and correct button placement/visibility.
*   ****: Contains utility functions for handling image URLs, specifically . Verified to be correctly processing team logos.
*   **Backend files (Laravel)**: Though not directly modifiable by the AI engineer, the descriptions in the trajectory indicate extensive updates to  (Model),  (for  method logic), and new routes for live-scoring endpoints ( equivalent). These changes are critical for the frontend to function correctly.

<pending_tasks>
-   **ComprehensiveLiveScoring Player Stat Updates:** Fix  causing 404 errors when updating player stats and hero changes. Resolve excessive re-rendering and component resets. Fix player image display.
-   **MatchDetailPage Display Issues:** Fix player names not showing, wrong player click navigation, and ensure full timer/status sync.
-   **Forums Data Display:** Resolve new categories not updating and backend API error loading forum data.
-   **Image Display across pages:** Fix article images not displaying. Ensure faded background images for event/live banners if not already working.
-   **UI Cleanup:** Remove unnecessary icons from Events and Home pages.
-   **Events Page Data:** Fix incorrect team/event data displayed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep in the process of debugging and fixing a series of critical frontend issues identified by the user after a significant backend transformation (performed by the user/previous AI engineer).

The previous phase focused on making the core match functionality work. This involved:
1.  **Fixing Player ID Mapping:** The AI engineer attempted to fix an issue where  was using  instead of , leading to  player IDs being sent to the backend and resulting in 404 errors for player stat updates.
2.  **UI/UX Enhancements for MatchDetailPage:** Correcting the display of player names, removing duplicate Watch VOD and Place Bet buttons, and adding the missing Watch Stream button. The game mode display was also added.
3.  **Timer Synchronization:** Ensuring the live timer from  correctly appeared and synced on .
4.  **MatchForm Hero Categorization & Pre-filling:** Ensuring heroes were displayed by their roles (Vanguard, Duelist, Strategist) instead of all and that previously selected heroes were pre-filled when editing a match.
5.  **API Cleanup:** Removing duplicate methods within  to streamline the codebase.
6.  **Image Backgrounds & Icon Cleanup:** Attempting to implement faded background images for event/live banners and remove unnecessary icons from Events and Home pages.

The AI engineer performed several builds, fixed various syntax errors (  and IIFE issues), and believed many issues were resolved. However, the last received message from the user (Chat Message 393-394) clearly indicates that the **critical  issue in  is *still unresolved***, causing player stat updates to fail with 404 errors (). This directly contradicts the AI engineer's previous assessment of the player ID mapping being fixed. This is the immediate, unresolved problem.
