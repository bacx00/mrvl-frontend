The AI engineer's work primarily focused on integrating frontend components with a tournament-ready backend for a Marvel Rivals esports platform. Initial efforts addressed frontend display issues, with a significant pivot when backend functionality was confirmed. The core challenge became resolving  and synchronization failures in  and . Recurring problems included backend URL interpretation, data structure mismatches ( vs. ), and the  field being a JSON string. Despite repeated claims of fixes, particularly for  properties and sync, the issues persisted, often with the AI engineer stating files were already updated. The trajectory concludes with the critical observation that  only receives  events, even though the admin interface dispatches all other sync events, indicating a fundamental problem with event listeners or data propagation.

The goal is a real-time Marvel Rivals esports platform. This includes robust match creation (6v6 teams, categorized heroes), live admin features (real-time player stats, hero changes, accurate score updates), and a public match display that shows live scores, player/hero details, and match status with seamless cross-tab synchronization. Image handling with fallbacks is crucial. The backend API promises instant data consistency. Minor UI polishes (removing unnecessary icons) are also required. The primary ongoing problem is the persistent failure of overall match scores and player statistics to update on , coupled with synchronization issues for hero changes, maps, game modes, and BO1/BO3/BO5 timer logic including preparation phases. The  being  and API responses returning HTML also plagued progress.

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Stores  for frontend API calls.
    -   **Summary**: Critical for configuring the backend API endpoint for the frontend application.
    -   **Changes Made**: Explicitly updated to  and a fallback was added.
-   ****: Centralizes all match-related frontend-backend communication.
    -   **Summary**: Handles fetching and updating match data, scores, and player statistics, acting as the data layer.
    -   **Changes Made**: Repeated attempts to correct API endpoints and data parsing. Initially modified for comprehensive backend admin endpoints and  sync. Key focus was aligning data transformation logic with the actual backend response (from expecting  to , and parsing  JSON string). It also had a compilation error due to duplicate variable declaration. Most recent changes were for complete match data sync.
-   ****: Handles match creation and editing.
    -   **Summary**: Manages input fields and data submission for creating and updating match details.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to include all 12 Marvel Rivals maps, all 6 game modes, and the complete 39-hero roster. Ensured correct map count per BO1/BO3/BO5 format. However, multiple attempts reported the file was already updated.
-   ****: The admin interface for live match updates.
    -   **Summary**: Manages real-time stats, hero changes, and timer events, dispatching updates for cross-tab sync.
    -   **Changes Made**: Multiple fixes attempted for  declaration. Logic for score/stat updates was modified to use new  methods and send correct map completion data. Significant efforts were made to ensure it sends *complete* match data (including  details, , ) during , , and  events to prevent crashes on the public page. Also had attempts to enhance timer sync and remove icons.
-   ****: Public-facing match detail view.
    -   **Summary**: Displays live scores, players, heroes, map, mode, and match status to the public. Listens for cross-tab sync events.
    -   **Changes Made**: Numerous fixes to handle  (e.g., , , ). Modified to use the  endpoint and correctly parse  and the  JSON string. Enhanced game mode detection with multiple fallbacks. Real-time sync was optimized to immediately update UI state for timers, heroes, and scores without unnecessary backend fetches. Debug logging was added. Icons were requested to be removed.
-   ****: Provides utility functions for image URLs.
    -   **Summary**: Helps construct image URLs for various assets.
    -   **Changes Made**: No explicit changes mentioned, but its  function was logged showing correct URL construction.
-   ****: Stores test results and problem statements.
    -   **Summary**: Used for tracking user problem statements and verification of fixes.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated multiple times by the user to reflect current test statuses and issues.
-   ****, ****, ****: Backend documentation files.
    -   **Summary**: Provides comprehensive API details, integration guides, and React examples for frontend developers.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created and provided by the user as part of backend handover. They serve as the source of truth for backend API structure, although actual backend responses sometimes deviated from their documented structure.

-   **Forums Data Display:** Issues with new categories not updating and backend API errors loading forum data.
-   **Image Display across pages:** Ensuring faded background images for event/live banners if not already working.
-   **Events Page Data:** Fixing incorrect team/event data displayed.
-   **Live Scoreboard Player Data Sync:** The  is not receiving updates for hero changes, scoreboard, and maps from , despite admin dispatching all event types. Only timer updates are consistently received. This implies an issue with event listeners or their processing on .

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into debugging real-time synchronization issues between the  (admin) and  (public view). The admin interface () was confirmed to be correctly dispatching various  types, including , , , , and , as verified by console logs from the  component.

However, the  was reported by the user (Chat Message 199) to be *only* receiving and processing  events. Other critical updates, such as changes to scoreboards or heroes initiated from the admin panel, were not reflecting on the , despite the admin explicitly dispatching these events. This indicates a fundamental problem with how  is listening for or processing these non-timer events.

The AI engineer's previous attempts to fix this, including ensuring complete match data was sent in sync events (Chat Message 182) and enhancing debug logging (Chat Message 198), have not resolved the core issue of events not being received/processed by the  event listeners. The current state is that the communication channel for non-timer updates is broken or misconfigured on the receiving end.
