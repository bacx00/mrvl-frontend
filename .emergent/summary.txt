The AI engineer's trajectory details the development and iterative debugging of a Marvel Rivals esports platform. Initially, the focus was on critical frontend bugs like  and match data persistence. A pivotal moment was the user providing new backend API documentation, which promised instant data consistency, fundamentally shifting the approach from client-side synchronization fixes to correct backend integration.

Key successes include fixing a  build error, integrating the new backend API endpoints into , and addressing several UI issues (image handling, icon removal, hero dropdown categorization). However, the core challenge of real-time scoreboard synchronization across tabs persisted. The engineer initially misdiagnosed this, believing the  sync mechanism was at fault, then that the user wasn't interacting with the correct UI elements (score buttons), and finally identified the backend's inconsistent handling of overall vs. map scores as the root cause. The trajectory concludes with the scoreboard synchronization still being an active problem, specifically the mismatch between map-level score updates and the overall match score displayed on the public page.

The goal is a fully functional Marvel Rivals esports platform with real-time live match capabilities. Key features and their current status include:

*   **Match Creation & Persistence ():** Admins create 6v6 matches with teams, modes, maps, and categorized Marvel Rivals heroes.  (hero compositions) must persist. The 'event' field is optional, and match status (, ) must update. (Addressed with initial  fixes, not primary focus in this trajectory).
*   **Live Match Administration ():** Real-time updates for player statistics (kills, deaths, assists, damage, healing, blocked damage) and hero changes without state loss. Player images and country flags must display correctly with a compact interface. Score increment/decrement buttons were added, and player stats input fields exist. (Hero changes and player stats updates are functional from admin side, but scoreboard sync from admin to public is pending).
*   **Public Match Display ():** Accurate display of match details: map name, game mode, heroes, player names, country flags. Real-time synchronization for timer, match status (, ), and scores. Includes Stream Watch and VOD buttons, with player rows linking to profiles. (Timer sync and hero changes are working. Player names display fixed. Scoreboard sync is still problematic).
*   **Image Display:** Correct display of team logos, player avatars, event/live banners, and news article images, with proper fallbacks and fading effects for banners. (News article image error handling fixed).
*   **Data Consistency:** Seamless, fully synchronized data flow from  to Backend, then to  and . This relies heavily on a new backend API that guarantees instant data consistency. (Backend API integration in  is complete, but frontend UI updates for scores are failing).
*   **UI Polish:** Removal of unnecessary icons from Events and Home pages. (Completed).

-   ****: Stores  for frontend API calls.
-   ****: Centralizes all match-related frontend-backend communication.
    -   **Summary**: This file handles all API requests to the backend. It's crucial for interacting with the live scoring system.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified to integrate the new comprehensive backend admin endpoints for live scoring (status, team composition, current map, timer, scores, player stats, live state) and public scoreboard. Logic for  was added/verified to use .
-   ****: Handles match creation and editing.
    -   **Summary**: Manages input fields for creating and updating match details.
    -   **Changes Made**: Previously updated for  and hero categorization. No direct modifications in this trajectory, but its output data structure () is consumed by .
-   ****: The admin interface for live match updates.
    -   **Summary**: Manages real-time stats, hero changes, and timer events. Sends updates to the backend and dispatches  events for cross-tab sync.
    -   **Changes Made**: Fixed . Updated  and  to use the new  methods. Replaced hardcoded maps and heroes with data fetched from  and . Added logic to transform API heroes (array) into a role-categorized object. Score increment/decrement buttons and associated  logic were added, which sends score updates to the backend and triggers cross-tab sync. Debugging logs were added to trace sync events.
-   ****: Public-facing match detail view.
    -   **Summary**: Displays scores, players, heroes, map, mode, and match status to the public. Listens for cross-tab sync events.
    -   **Changes Made**: Logic for handling  events (, ) was re-added/corrected after accidental removal, ensuring  state updates to fetch fresh data. Player name display fixed by aligning data structure ( vs ). Debugging logs added.
-   ****: Provides utility functions for image URLs.
    -   **Summary**: Helps construct image URLs for various assets like team logos.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct modifications in this trajectory, but it was implicitly verified to be working.
-   ****: Displays news articles.
    -   **Summary**: Shows news articles, potentially with images.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  handling for images to gracefully hide broken images.
-   ****: Displays events.
    -   **Summary**: Shows event information.
    -   **Changes Made**: Removed unnecessary icons to clean up UI.
-   ****: The application's main landing page.
    -   **Summary**: Displays high-level information or featured content.
    -   **Changes Made**: Removed unnecessary ðŸ”´ LIVE NOW icon.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving the persistent issue of scoreboard synchronization between the admin  and the public .

The current state is as follows:
*   **Admin-side actions are working:** The  component successfully makes API calls to  when the score increment/decrement buttons are clicked.
*   **Backend is receiving and processing updates:** Console logs confirm the backend is receiving the score updates (specifically for ) and responds with success ().
*   **Cross-tab synchronization events are triggered:**  events ( with ) are correctly dispatched from the admin page and received by the public .
*   ** refreshes:** Upon receiving the  event,  correctly triggers a refresh by calling , which fetches data from .

**The core problem identified:** The backend response from the scoreboard API () consistently shows  for the *overall match score*, even when the  array within the same response correctly reflects the updated map score (e.g., ). Since the  is configured to display the *overall match scores*, it never updates, creating a discrepancy.

The AI engineer's last action was to attempt to force the overall match score to reflect the map leader, but this change was found to be already present in the code, suggesting the issue lies either in the backend's data aggregation for the  endpoint or a deeper misinterpretation of the frontend's display logic for overall vs. map scores. The user's latest feedback confirms the issue persists: nope! data.
