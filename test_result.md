- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind styles work properly with responsive design
- **Error Handling**: Frontend properly handles backend connection errors with fallback UI
- **Authentication Modal**: Authentication modal opens and closes correctly

### **🧪 Backend Service Issues (June 20, 2025):**
- **Backend Service Error**: Backend service fails to start with error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`
- **API Endpoints**: All API endpoints return 502 errors due to backend service failure
- **Configuration Issue**: Supervisor configuration is looking for a non-existent module path: `backend.server:app`
- **Directory Structure**: The expected `/app/backend/` directory does not exist
- **Service Status**: Backend service shows as running in supervisor but is actually failing

### **🔍 Testing Limitations:**
- Cannot test hero image integration due to backend issues
- Cannot test team image integration due to backend issues
- Cannot test match creation workflow due to backend issues
- Cannot test live match integration due to backend issues
- Cannot test admin features due to login failure

## 🤖 **AGENT COMMUNICATION:**

### **Testing Agent (June 20, 2025):**
- **Critical Backend Issue**: The backend service is failing to start due to a missing module. The error is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`. The expected `/app/backend/` directory does not exist.
- **API Endpoints**: All API endpoints are returning 502 Bad Gateway errors due to the backend service failure.
- **Frontend UI**: The frontend UI is implemented correctly and handles backend connection errors gracefully, but cannot load any data due to backend issues.
- **Testing Limitations**: Cannot test any functionality that requires backend interaction, including hero image integration, team image integration, match creation, and live match integration.
- **Recommendation**: Fix the backend directory structure and module path before proceeding with further testing.

### **Main Agent (June 20, 2025):**
- Working on implementing the hero image integration with the new endpoint: `/api/heroes/{name}/image`
- Team image integration is using the storage paths: `https://staging.mrvl.net/storage/teams/team_X_logo_Y.png`
- Match creation workflow for BO1 matches is implemented with exactly 1 map
- Live match integration is implemented with real-time sync between admin and match detail
- Hero categorization by role (Tank/Duelist/Support) is implemented

### **Testing Agent (June 21, 2025):**
- **Hero Image System Test Results**: Tested the hero image system integration on the match detail page.
- **API Integration**: The hero image API endpoint `/api/heroes/{name}/image` is working correctly and returns the proper image URL.
- **Frontend Issue**: Found an issue with the hero image URL construction in the frontend. The frontend is trying to load images from an incorrect URL format: `https://staging.mrvl.net/Heroes/https://staging.mrvl.net/api/heroes/captain-america/image` instead of the correct format: `https://staging.mrvl.net/storage/heroes/captain_america.webp`.
- **Image Availability**: Direct access to hero images at `https://staging.mrvl.net/storage/heroes/captain_america.webp` works correctly.
- **Text Fallbacks**: No text fallbacks are being displayed for heroes without images, as the incorrect URL format is preventing the error handling from triggering properly.
- **Recommendation**: Fix the URL construction in the frontend code. The issue appears to be in how the frontend is using the API response. It should extract the `image_url` from the API response and use it directly, rather than concatenating the API URL with the response.

### **Testing Agent (June 21, 2025 - Update):**
- **Hero Image System Fix Verification**: The fix for the hero image URL construction has been implemented correctly in the `getHeroImage` function.
- **Direct URL Testing**: Direct access to hero images at `https://staging.mrvl.net/storage/heroes/captain_america.webp`, `https://staging.mrvl.net/storage/heroes/hulk.webp`, `https://staging.mrvl.net/storage/heroes/black_widow.webp`, and `https://staging.mrvl.net/storage/heroes/venom.webp` works correctly.
- **Text Fallback Verification**: Heroes without images (Iron Man, Spider-Man, Thor, Storm, Rocket Raccoon) correctly return 404 errors when accessed directly, which should trigger the text fallback in the UI.
- **Backend Issues**: The backend service is still failing to start due to a missing module. The error is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`. The expected `/app/backend/` directory does not exist.
- **Testing Limitations**: Cannot fully test the hero image integration in the UI due to the backend service failure, but the code changes look correct.
- **Recommendation**: Fix the backend directory structure and module path to enable full testing of the hero image system.

### **Testing Agent (June 26, 2025):**
- **Marvel Rivals API Testing**: Successfully tested the Marvel Rivals platform backend APIs using the staging.mrvl.net domain.
- **Match Creation API**: Successfully tested POST /api/admin/matches with the maps_data payload structure. The API accepts and processes the request correctly.
- **Match Scoreboard API**: Successfully tested GET /api/matches/{id}/scoreboard. The endpoint returns match data with team and player information.
- **Match Detail API**: Successfully tested GET /api/matches/{id} and compared it with GET /api/matches/{id}/scoreboard. Both endpoints return similar data.
- **Maps Data**: The maps_data field is accepted in the match creation API, but it's not visible in the match detail or scoreboard responses. The maps are shown in a simplified format.
- **Team Logos**: Team logos are correctly returned in both endpoints with paths like "/storage/teams/team_83_logo_1750194818.png".
- **Player Information**: Player information is correctly returned in both endpoints, including roles and avatars.
- **Hero Compositions**: The hero compositions submitted in maps_data are not visible in the responses, suggesting they might be stored but not returned in these endpoints.
- **Scoreboard Endpoint**: The scoreboard endpoint returns similar data to the match detail endpoint, with a slightly different structure. It includes main_hero information for players that the detail endpoint doesn't have.
- **Recommendation**: The APIs are working correctly, but the frontend may need to handle the fact that hero compositions from maps_data are not directly visible in the responses.

### **Testing Agent (June 26, 2025 - Update 2):**
- **Match Creation with Hero Compositions**: Successfully tested creating matches with hero compositions in the maps_data field. The API accepts the data correctly.
- **Match Detail Endpoint**: The match detail endpoint (/api/matches/{id}) returns complete team and player data, including team logos and player information.
- **Scoreboard Endpoint**: The scoreboard endpoint (/api/matches/{id}/scoreboard) returns complete data with team logos and player information, including main_hero data for each player.
- **Hero Compositions Storage**: While the maps_data with hero compositions is accepted during match creation, these compositions are not directly visible in either the match detail or scoreboard responses.
- **Team Logos**: Team logos are correctly included in both the match detail and scoreboard responses with paths like "/storage/teams/team_27_logo_1750190799.png".
- **Player Hero Data**: The scoreboard endpoint includes main_hero information for each player, which is not present in the match detail endpoint.
- **Data Synchronization**: The data between match detail and scoreboard endpoints is consistent, with the scoreboard providing additional player hero information.
- **Conclusion**: The three critical fixes (MatchForm maps_data, MatchDetailPage scoreboard endpoint, ComprehensiveLiveScoring team logos) are working correctly. The frontend should be updated to use the main_hero data from the scoreboard endpoint for displaying player heroes.

### **Testing Agent (June 26, 2025 - Update 3):**
- **Live Scoring API Testing**: Successfully tested the live scoring functionality APIs for Match ID 114.
- **GET /api/matches/114/scoreboard**: This endpoint is working correctly (200 OK) and returns complete match data with team and player information.
- **Player IDs in Scoreboard**: All players in the scoreboard response have proper ID fields. Player IDs are available in both the team player lists and the map compositions.
- **POST /api/matches/{id}/players/{playerId}/stats**: This endpoint is working correctly (201 Created) and accepts player statistics updates.
- **Authentication Requirement**: The player stats update endpoint requires authentication. Requests without authentication receive a 401 Unauthorized response.
- **Invalid Player ID Handling**: The endpoint correctly returns a 404 Not Found response for invalid player IDs.
- **Frontend Issue Analysis**: The frontend issue where `playerId` is undefined when trying to save player stats is likely due to incorrect data mapping in the frontend. The player IDs are properly included in the scoreboard response, but the frontend may not be extracting them correctly.
- **Recommendation**: Fix the frontend data mapping to correctly extract player IDs from the scoreboard response. The player IDs are available in the `teams.team1.players[].id`, `teams.team2.players[].id`, `maps[].team1_composition[].player_id`, and `maps[].team2_composition[].player_id` fields.

### **Testing Agent (June 28, 2025):**
- **Marvel Rivals MatchAPI.js Integration Testing**: Attempted to test the new MatchAPI.js endpoints for instant data consistency.
- **Backend Service Issue**: All API endpoints are returning 502 Bad Gateway errors. The backend service is failing to start due to a missing module: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`.
- **Configuration Issue**: The supervisor configuration is looking for a non-existent module path: `backend.server:app`. The expected `/app/backend/` directory does not exist.
- **Frontend Status**: The frontend is running correctly but cannot connect to the backend API endpoints.
- **Testing Limitations**: Cannot test any of the new MatchAPI.js endpoints due to the backend service failure.
- **Endpoints Attempted to Test**:
  - PUT /api/admin/matches/{id}/status - for match status updates
  - PUT /api/admin/matches/{id}/team-composition - for hero changes
  - PUT /api/admin/matches/{id}/current-map - for map/mode updates
  - PUT /api/admin/matches/{id}/timer - for timer control
  - PUT /api/admin/matches/{id}/scores - for score updates
  - PUT /api/admin/matches/{id}/player-stats/{playerId} - for player statistics
  - GET /api/admin/matches/{id}/live-state - for complete live state
  - GET /api/game-data/all-heroes - for Marvel Rivals heroes
  - GET /api/game-data/maps - for maps
  - GET /api/game-data/modes - for game modes
  - GET /api/matches/{id}/scoreboard - public endpoint with cache-busting headers
- **Recommendation**: Fix the backend directory structure and module path before proceeding with further testing. The backend directory should be created at `/app/backend/` with a `server.py` file that contains the FastAPI application.
