## 🧪 **TESTING AGENT VERIFICATION:**

### **⚠️ Critical Testing Issues:**
- **Backend Service**: Backend service is not running correctly - showing 502 errors for all API endpoints
- **Backend Module Error**: Backend service fails to start due to missing 'backend' module
- **Frontend Integration**: Frontend is running but cannot connect to backend API endpoints
- **Authentication**: Authentication modal works but login fails due to backend issues
- **Image Integration**: Unable to test hero and team image integration due to backend issues

### **✅ Frontend UI Testing Results:**
- **UI Navigation**: Basic navigation between pages works correctly
- **UI Components**: UI components render correctly without backend data
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind styles work properly with responsive design
- **Error Handling**: Frontend properly handles backend connection errors with fallback UI
- **Authentication Modal**: Authentication modal opens and closes correctly

### **🧪 Backend Service Issues (June 20, 2025):**
- **Backend Service Error**: Backend service fails to start with error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`
- **API Endpoints**: All API endpoints return 502 errors due to backend service failure
- **Configuration Issue**: Supervisor configuration is looking for a non-existent module path: `backend.server:app`
- **Directory Structure**: The expected `/app/backend/` directory does not exist
- **Service Status**: Backend service shows as running in supervisor but is actually failing

### **🔍 Testing Limitations:**
- Cannot test hero image integration due to backend issues
- Cannot test team image integration due to backend issues
- Cannot test match creation workflow due to backend issues
- Cannot test live match integration due to backend issues
- Cannot test admin features due to login failure

## 🤖 **AGENT COMMUNICATION:**

### **Testing Agent (June 20, 2025):**
- **Critical Backend Issue**: The backend service is failing to start due to a missing module. The error is `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`. The expected `/app/backend/` directory does not exist.
- **API Endpoints**: All API endpoints are returning 502 Bad Gateway errors due to the backend service failure.
- **Frontend UI**: The frontend UI is implemented correctly and handles backend connection errors gracefully, but cannot load any data due to backend issues.
- **Testing Limitations**: Cannot test any functionality that requires backend interaction, including hero image integration, team image integration, match creation, and live match integration.
- **Recommendation**: Fix the backend directory structure and module path before proceeding with further testing.

### **Main Agent (June 20, 2025):**
- Working on implementing the hero image integration with the new endpoint: `/api/heroes/{name}/image`
- Team image integration is using the storage paths: `https://staging.mrvl.net/storage/teams/team_X_logo_Y.png`
- Match creation workflow for BO1 matches is implemented with exactly 1 map
- Live match integration is implemented with real-time sync between admin and match detail
- Hero categorization by role (Tank/Duelist/Support) is implemented

### **Testing Agent (June 21, 2025):**
- **Hero Image System Test Results**: Tested the hero image system integration on the match detail page.
- **API Integration**: The hero image API endpoint `/api/heroes/{name}/image` is working correctly and returns the proper image URL.
- **Frontend Issue**: Found an issue with the hero image URL construction in the frontend. The frontend is trying to load images from an incorrect URL format: `https://staging.mrvl.net/Heroes/https://staging.mrvl.net/api/heroes/captain-america/image` instead of the correct format: `https://staging.mrvl.net/storage/heroes/captain_america.webp`.
- **Image Availability**: Direct access to hero images at `https://staging.mrvl.net/storage/heroes/captain_america.webp` works correctly.
- **Text Fallbacks**: No text fallbacks are being displayed for heroes without images, as the incorrect URL format is preventing the error handling from triggering properly.
- **Recommendation**: Fix the URL construction in the frontend code. The issue appears to be in how the frontend is using the API response. It should extract the `image_url` from the API response and use it directly, rather than concatenating the API URL with the response.
